//Stable matching problem
// Consider a town with n men and n women seeking to get married to one
// another. Each man has a preference list that ranks all the women, and each
// woman has a preference list that ranks all the men.
// The set of all 2n people is divided into two categories: good people and
// bad people. Suppose that for some number k, 1≤ k ≤ n − 1, there are k good
// men and k good women; thus there are n − k bad men and n − k bad women.
// Everyone would rather marry any good person than any bad person.
// Formally, each preference list has the property that it ranks each good person
// of the opposite gender higher than each bad person of the opposite gender: its
// first k entries are the good people (of the opposite gender) in some order, and
// its next n − k are the bad people (of the opposite gender) in some order.
// Show that in every stable matching, every good man is married to a good woman.
